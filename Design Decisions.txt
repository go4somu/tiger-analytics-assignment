Design Decisions

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React.js for a SPA, easy state management and AJAX calls.
Backend: Java + Spring Boot provides a robust, enterprise-grade solution.
Database: PostgreSQL, a reliable relational DB that can scale to handle 3000 stores and large datasets.

CSV Processing:
Processed server-side using OpenCSV or standard Java CSV parsing libraries.
Bulk insert to reduce database overhead.

Scalability:
Stateless REST API allows horizontal scaling via Kubernetes.
Database indices on frequently searched fields (e.g., store_id, sku) to improve query performance.

Security:
Could implement JWT-based authentication.
Secure connections with HTTPS (enforced by load balancer or ingress).
